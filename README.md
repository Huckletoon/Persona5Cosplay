# Persona5Cosplay
# What is this?
This a mod for the game Terraria to be made using the framework provided by tModLoader found [here](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/1-3-tmodloader-a-modding-api.23726/).
I found Persona 5 to be one of my favorite games in quite some time, and I've been wanting to attempt modding Terraria for a while.

# Summary of Planned Features
- 9 Basic armor sets
   - Armor based on each party member: Joker, Skull, Mona, Panther, Fox, Queen, Oracle, Noir, and Crow
   - 7 Tiers for each set
- A bunch of weapons, not sure how many exactly
   - Magic: Spells from SMT, like Agi, Bufula, Megido, etc.
   - Melee: Weapons fitting each party member, possibly different tiers like the armor
   - Ranged: Guns fitting each party member, again possibly different tiers
- Accessories, not sure what yet
   - Bring some over from Persona
   - Rebellious Spirit: Increases HP, Mana, Defense, and Crit chance based on armor set tier
- Toggleable custom P5-themed Health and Mana UI
- Buffs
   - Rakukaja: Increased defense, mainly for Queen armor set bonuses
